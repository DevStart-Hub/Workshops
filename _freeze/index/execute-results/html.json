These workshops sometimes are part of larger events like conferences, bigger workshops, or summer schools, and sometimes we organize them on our own. <br><br> This website serves us as a small hub to provide the participants of each specific workshop with all the relevant information, materials, and resources as sometimes these are slightly different from one event to another. <br><br><br>\n\n### Topics\n\nOur workshops cover different topics including:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Eye-Tracking</summary>\n\n- Design developmentally appropriate eye-tracking experiments\n- Collect data using DeToX, our Python package for Tobii eye-trackers\n- Preprocess data with fixation classification methods optimized for young participants\n- Analyze gaze patterns and attention measures\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Statistical Analysis</summary>\n\n- Linear and generalized mixed-effects models for complex developmental designs\n- Bayesian statistical modelling\n- Publication-ready data visualization\n\n</details>\n\nand we are working on expanding our themes and topics even further! \n<br>\n\n## Our workshops past and future..\n\nWant to check what we are planning and working on?? here is a list of our workshops both future one and old one we did.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"timeline-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"timeline-container\">\n\n    <div class=\"timeline-item past\">\n      <div class=\"timeline-date-container\">\n        <div class=\"timeline-date\">3-4 April, 2025</div>\n        <div class=\"timeline-location\">Birkbeck Uni (London)</div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"timeline-center\">\n        <div class=\"timeline-line\"></div>\n        <div class=\"timeline-icon\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"timeline-content timeline-no-link\">\n        <h3>Eye-tracking Workshop for Developmental Scientist</h3>\n        <p>Our first eye-tracking workshop designed to guide developmental researchers through the complete workflow, from collecting eye-tracking data with infants and children to preprocessing and analyzing gaze data</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"timeline-item\" id=\"current-event\">\n      <div class=\"timeline-date-container\">\n        <div class=\"timeline-date\">12-13 Jan, 2026</div>\n        <div class=\"timeline-location\">Chieti Uni</div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"timeline-center\">\n        <div class=\"timeline-line\"></div>\n        <div class=\"timeline-icon\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <a href=\"https://devstart.org/Workshops/Workshops/2026_Chieti/index.html\" class=\"timeline-content\">\n        <h3>A Practical Introduction to Eye-tracking for Developmental Science</h3>\n        <p>Practical workshop focused on designing and implementing developmental eye-tracking studies.
