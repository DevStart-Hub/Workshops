## Pre-Workshop Setup

This workshop provides hands-on experience with eye-tracking data collection and analysis. In line with DevStart's commitment to open science, we'll use free, open-source software and programming languages throughout.

We'll be using **Python** and **PsychoPy** for experiment creation and data collection.

### Sofware Installation

To ensure you're ready for the workshop, please follow our step-by-step installation guide. We've created interactive flowcharts on the DevStart website that walk you through installing everything you'll need. If you're new to these tools, simply click the buttons to navigate to the most relevant sections based on your experience level and goals.

**Please complete the setup before the workshop begins.**

### Installation Guide
The setup process typically takes 20-30 minutes, though some software can be complex to install. We've included alternative installation methods and solutions for common problems to ensure everything goes smoothly.

Please do not worry if something goes wrong, as these installations can sometimes be complicated. We will try to help you troubleshoot on the day of the workshop! If you encounter any major issues please email us at [t.ghilardi@bbk.ac.uk](mailto:t.ghilardi@bbk.ac.uk).
