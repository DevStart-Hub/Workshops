## About the Workshop

This workshop, organized by Prof. Maria Spinelli, is led by the [DevStart](devstart.org) team and provides a practical introduction to eye-tracking methods in developmental science. Participants will learn the complete research pipeline—from designing developmental experimental paradigms, to collecting high-quality eye-tracking data and preprocessing it for analysis.

Throughout the workshop, we'll emphasize practical skills and best practices specific to developmental populations, including calibration techniques for young participants and handling common challenges when working with infants. All methods will be taught using open-source tools, primarily Python for experiment design and data collection.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have the foundational knowledge and practical experience needed to start their own eye-tracking research with developmental populations.
